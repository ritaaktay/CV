## Skills

#### Innovation and Follow-Through 

- I have the courage to approach any problem through a lense of practical innovation and can follow through to overcome challenges during implementation. Curating a digital exhibition for the British Council, I diverged from the pervasive OVR (Online Viewing Room) model and designed an interactive platform based on the tag & filter systems of retail websites. Under my leadership, our team of artistic advisors and digital designers were able to overcome each blocker when producing a custom made platform. 

#### Learning Fast and Teaching Others 

- An enthusiastic and ambitious fast-learner, I often find myself in the position of teaching newly acquired skills to colleagues. During my time at Makers Academy, coursemates praised my ability to explain complex concepts to people of all skill-levels, thereby speeding up the implementation of our projects. For example, I was able to help my teammates implement new datatypes in SQL for a four-day project building an Airbnb clone. My ability to pick something up fast yet comprehensively helped push our project forward in a short time-frame.

## Interests

- Training in tennis, swimming, running, sailing, and outdoor sports.
- Learning new things in psychology, sociology, history and philosophy.
