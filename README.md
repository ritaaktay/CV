## Skills

#### Innovation

- I have the courage to approach any problem through a lense of practical innovation, and can follow through to overcome challenges during implementation. Curating a digital exhibition for the Britihs Council, I diverged from the pervasive OVR (Online Viewing Room) model and designed an interactive platform based on the tag & filter systems of retial websites. Under my leadership, our team of artistic advisors and digital designers were able to problem-solve each hurdle in producing a custom made platform. 

#### Mentorship 

- An enthusiastic and driven fast-learner, I often find myself in the position of teaching my newly acquired skills to colleagues. During my time at Makers Academy, coursemates praised my ability to explain complex concepts to people of all skill-levels, thereby speeding up the implementation of our projects. For example, I was able to help my teammates quickly impelment new datatypes in SQL for a short four-day project building an Airbnb clone.
